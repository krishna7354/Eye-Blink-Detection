# Eye Blink Detection Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project is a real-time eye blink detection system that uses computer vision and OpenCV to track and analyze eye movements. The main goal is to identify when a person blinks, which can have applications in areas like driver alertness detection, fatigue monitoring, and interactive systems.

## üèÜ Goals of the Project
1. **Real-Time Detection**: Accurately detect eye blinks in real-time using a webcam.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Implement a robust and efficient detection mechanism using Haar Cascade classifiers.
3. **Scalable Design**: Ensure the system is adaptable for other face and eye-based recognition tasks.

## üß† Why Use This Project?
- **Driver Safety**: Monitor driver fatigue by detecting frequent or prolonged eye closures.
- **Healthcare**: Track eye blinks for patients with neurological conditions or during sleep studies.
- **Interactive Systems**: Enable hands-free control of devices using blinks as a trigger.

---

## ‚úÖ Advantages
- **Lightweight**: Uses pre-trained Haar Cascade models, making the system lightweight and efficient.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides immediate visual feedback to indicate the state of eye detection.
- **Customizable**: Can be tailored for different applications like facial expression detection or emotion analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- **Python 3.x**: Programming language used for the project.
- **OpenCV**: For image and video processing.
- **Hardware**: A webcam for real-time detection.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Haar Cascade classifiers for face and eye detection (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` and `haarcascade_eye_tree_eyeglasses.xml`).

Install the dependencies using:
